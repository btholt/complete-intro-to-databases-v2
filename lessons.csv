02H,Nosql,MongoDB Ops,nosql/mongodb-ops,info-circle,/lessons/nosql/mongodb-ops,"While developers don't necessarily need to know how to run a database cluster in production, it can be important to know how and why databases are being run the way they are.

03C,Sql,Querying Postgresql,sql/querying-postgresql,info-circle,/lessons/sql/querying-postgresql,SQL is a very flexible and expressive way to describe what data you want out of a database. In this section Brian talks about the various ways to read from and modify a database using SQL.
03D,Sql,Complex Sql Queries,sql/complex-sql-queries,info-circle,/lessons/sql/complex-sql-queries,"Brian dives into how to compound queries, joins, unions, group bys, and other ways to get obtain powerful results with the expressiveness of SQL"
03E,Sql,JSON in PostgreSQL,sql/json-in-postgresql,info-circle,/lessons/sql/json-in-postgresql,One of PostgreSQL's super powers is that it's able to store and query JSON
03F,Sql,Indexes in Postgresql,sql/indexes-in-postgresql,info-circle,/lessons/sql/indexes-in-postgresql,Indexes are critical to a well functional relational database. Brian quickly explains how to investigate query performance and how to create an index to solve that problem.
03G,Sql,Node.js App with PostgreSQL,sql/nodejs-app-with-postgresql,info-circle,/lessons/sql/nodejs-app-with-postgresql,"To help transfer learnings from the command line to code, Brian shows you how to quickly write an app for our message board tables using Node.js"
03H,Sql,Hasura,sql/hasura,info-circle,/lessons/sql/hasura,"Brian gives a quick overview of a powerful tool to use with PostgreSQL, Hasura. Hasura is a service you will put in your cluster so you can query your PostgreSQL database with GraphQL."
03I,Sql,PostgreSQL Ops,sql/postgresql-ops,info-circle,/lessons/sql/postgresql-ops,"While it is not important for a developer to know how to precisely manage a database cluster in production, a developer does need to know a bit how about how it is done so they can plan accordingly when they write their code."
04A,Graph,Graph Databases,graph/graph-databases,info-circle,/lessons/graph/graph-databases,Graph databases are great when you need to define relations between objects that can have complex webs of relations especially for things like social networks.
04B,Graph,Neo4j,graph/neo4j,info-circle,/lessons/graph/neo4j,Graph databases are great when you need to define relations between objects that can have complex webs of relations especially for things like social networks.
04C,Graph,Neo4j Browser,graph/neo4j-browser,info-circle,/lessons/graph/neo4j-browser,An amazing tool that Neo4j provides dev is a built in browser that allows you run queries and visualize your graph
04D,Graph,Complex Neo4j Queries,graph/complex-neo4j-queries,info-circle,/lessons/graph/complex-neo4j-queries,Graph databases are great when you need to define relations between objects that can have complex webs of relations especially for things like social networks.
