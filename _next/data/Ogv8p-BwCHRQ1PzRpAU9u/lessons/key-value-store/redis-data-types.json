We won't go over all of them because most of them cover more advance usecases but so you know here they are:\n\n- Strings (binary safe, so you could write the contents of JPEG here)\n  - Technically numbers/integers are implemented as strings\n- Lists (i.e. arrays)\n- Sets\n- Sorted sets (similar to above but every thing has a \"score\" to it so you can grab the top ten values. Think priority queue sort of idea)\n- Hashes (think JS object or Python hash)\n- HyperLogLogs (not kidding, that's the name, we're not covering them)\n- Streams (basically an append-only stream of data, think an ongoing log of data)\n\nYou've already seen a string. Try running\n\n```redis\nSET name Brian\nTYPE name # string\nSET visits 10\nTYPE visits # string\n```\n\n## Lists\n\nI don't find myself frequently needing lists with Redis but a good use case may be notifications for a user. Let's say you have a user that has three notifications you need to add\n\n```redis\nRPUSH notifications:btholt \"Call your mom\" \"Feed the dog\" \"Take out trash\"\nLRANGE notifications:btholt 0 -1\n```\n\n- `RPUSH` can be thought of as a push on a stack. You're adding thing(s) to the end of a list.\n- `LRANGE` can be thought of as the `GET` for lists (GET doesn't work on lists). It always requires the indexes you want to get so `0 -1` gets you the whole list. You can give it `1 5` and that will be the 1 index (i.e. the second) element to the 5 index element.

You could do.\n\n```redis\nRPOP mylist\n```\n\n- This, like pop on stack, will return the last item on the list and remove it from the list.\n- LPOP does the same from the front of the list.\n- LPUSH also works as well, adding items to the front.\n- LTRIM allows you to truncate list. If I said `LTRIM notifications:btholt 0 5` it'd drop any notifications beyond five. This is useful if we don't let btholt get any more than five notifications at a time.\n\n## Hashes\n\nThink of hashes like an object in Redis. Maybe we could repsent btholt's user like this\n\n```redis\nHMSET btholt:profile title \"principal program manager\" company \"Microsoft\" city \"Seattle\" state \"WA\"\nHGET btholt:profile city\nHGETALL btholt:profile\n```\n\nUserful if we don't want to have separate keys for all of these. Do note that most of the operators like `INCR` exists for hashes as well e.g. `HINCR`. [See here][hash].\n\n## Sets and Sorted Sets\n\nA set is just a group of things. In our case it will be a group of strings which won't have a concept of order. For example if you had a set of colors. There's no \"order\" to a set of colors, it's just a group. We could do this.\n\n```redis\nSADD colors red blue green yellow\nSMEMBERS colors\nSISMEMBER colors green # true\nSISMEMBER colors gold # false\nSPOP colors # removes and returns a random element\n```\n\nThere's another sort of set that's called a sorted set that allows you to add priorities so that you can ask for the top ten things in a list.
