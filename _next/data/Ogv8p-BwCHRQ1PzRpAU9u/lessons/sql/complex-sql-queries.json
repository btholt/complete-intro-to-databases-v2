The interesting part here is that every comment is posted by a user and therefore will need to reference the user table, and it will be posted to board and therefore will need to reference a board from the boards table. This is what you would call relational data and where relational databases really shine.</p>\n<h2>Foreign Keys</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s jot down all of our schemas for our users, boards, and comments.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\">\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CREATE TABLE</span> users (\n  user_id <span class=\"hljs-type\">INTEGER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">PRIMARY KEY</span> GENERATED ALWAYS <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">IDENTITY</span>,\n  username <span class=\"hljs-type\">VARCHAR</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-number\">25</span> ) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">UNIQUE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>,\n  email <span class=\"hljs-type\">VARCHAR</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> ) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">UNIQUE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>,\n  full_name <span class=\"hljs-type\">VARCHAR</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span> ) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>,\n  last_login <span class=\"hljs-type\">TIMESTAMP</span>,\n  created_on <span class=\"hljs-type\">TIMESTAMP</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CREATE TABLE</span> boards (\n  board_id <span class=\"hljs-type\">INTEGER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">PRIMARY KEY</span> GENERATED ALWAYS <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">IDENTITY</span>,\n  board_name <span class=\"hljs-type\">VARCHAR</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> ) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">UNIQUE</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>,\n  board_description TEXT <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">CREATE TABLE</span> comments (\n  comment_id <span class=\"hljs-type\">INTEGER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">PRIMARY KEY</span> GENERATED ALWAYS <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">IDENTITY</span>,\n  user_id <span class=\"hljs-type\">INT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">REFERENCES</span> users(user_id) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DELETE</span> CASCADE,\n  board_id <span class=\"hljs-type\">INT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">REFERENCES</span> boards(board_id) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DELETE</span> CASCADE,\n  comment TEXT <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NOT NULL</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-type\">time</span> <span class=\"hljs-type\">TIMESTAMP</span>\n);\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>The first two should look pretty familiar. The only new-ish thing is the user of the <code>TEXT</code> data type. This is basically a VARCHAR with no cap (or rather a very large cap.) It has some other small differences but for now just know it&#39;s uncapped text.</li>\n<li><code>user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id)</code> is technically all you need to make a foreign key. The first part, <code>INT</code>, makes it known that this key will be stored as an integer. It then uses the <code>REFERENCES</code> key word to let PostgreSQL know that it is a foreign key. A foreign key is a field in one table that references the <strong>primary</strong> key of another table. In this case, a comment will reference the user_id in another table, the users table. The <code>users</code> part say it&#39;s reference the users table and the <code>(user_id)</code> is the name of the key in the other table. In this case, we called both user_id (which will probably happen somewhat frequently but not always) so they match but if we had called the user_id just id in the users table, we&#39;d put <code>id</code> there.</li>\n<li><code>ON DELETE CASCADE</code> lets PostgreSQL know what to do if the user gets deleted. So if a user makes a comment on the message board and then deletes their account, what do you want it to do? If you omit the <code>ON DELETE CASCADE</code> part, it&#39;s the same as doing <code>ON DELETE NO ACTION</code> which means it&#39;ll just error and not let you delete the user until you&#39;ve deleted all the comments first. You can also do <code>ON DELETE SET NULL</code> which means it&#39;ll make the user_id null on any comment that was made by that user.</li>\n<li>We&#39;ve dne the same for board_id, just referencing the boards table instead of the users table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#39;s go ahead and put some dummy data in there. Copy / paste [this query] into your psql terminal. It may take a few minutes.</p>\n<h2>JOIN</h2>\n<p>So a user goes to your message board and click</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> comment_id, user_id, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">LEFT</span>(comment, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> preview <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> comments <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span> board_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">39</span>;\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Two new things here.

If we don&#39;t use AS here, the string will be returned under they key <code>left</code> which doesn&#39;t make sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay so you&#39;ll get something back like this:</p>\n<pre><code> comment_id | user_id |       preview\n------------+---------+----------------------\n         63 |     858 | Maecenas tristique,\n        358 |     876 | Mauris enim leo, rho\n        429 |     789 | Maecenas ut massa qu\n        463 |     925 | Phasellus sit amet e\n        485 |     112 | Maecenas tristique,\n        540 |     588 | Nullam porttitor lac\n        545 |     587 | Praesent id massa id\n        972 |     998 | Aenean lectus. Pelle\n(8 rows)\n</code></pre><p>We can&#39;t really use this to display the comments on our web app because your users don&#39;t care what user_id posted these comments, they want the username. But that doesn&#39;t live in the comments table, that exists in the users table. So how do we connect those together?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span>\n  comment_id, comments.user_id, users.username, <span class=\"hljs-type\">time</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">LEFT</span>(comment, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> preview\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span>\n  comments\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INNER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">JOIN</span>\n  users\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span>\n  comments.user_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> users.user_id\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span>\n  board_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">39</span>;\n</code></pre><p>Magic! The big key here is the <code>INNER JOIN</code> which allows us to match up all the keys from one table to another. We do that in <code>ON</code> clause where we say user<em>ids match is where you can _join</em> together those records into one record.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about <code>INNER</code> for a second. There are multiple kinds of JOINs. INNER is a good one start with. It says &quot;find where user_ids match. If you find a record where the user_id exists in one but not in the other, omit it in the results.&quot; This isn&#39;t a particularly useful distinction for us right now becase all user_ids will exist in users and we&#39;re assured of that due to the foreign key restraints we used. However if a comment had a user_id that didn&#39;t exist, it would omit that comment in the results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SQL_Joins.svg\"><img src=\"./images/SQL_Joins.png\" alt=\"diagram of SQL joins\"></a></p>\n<p>A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> would say &quot;if a comment has a user_id that doesn&#39;t exist, include it anyway.&quot; A <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> wouldn&#39;t make much sense here but it would include users even if they didn&#39;t have a comment on that board.</p>\n<p>We can also an <code>OUTER JOIN</code> which would be everything that <em>doesn&#39;t match</em>. In our database, that would be nothing because we&#39;re guaranteed everything has match due to our constraints.</p>\n<p>You can also do a <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> which says just include everything. If it doesn&#39;t have a match from either side, include it. If it does have a match, include it.</p>\n<p>Another rarely useful join is the <code>CROSS JOIN</code>. This gives the <em>Cartesian product</em> of the two tables which can be enormous. A Cartesian product would be every row matched with every other row in the other table. If you have A, B, and C in one table with D and E in the other, your CROSS JOIN would be AD, AE, BD, BE, CD, an CE. If you do a cross join between two tables with 1,000 rows each, you&#39;d get 1,000,000 records back.</p>\n<p>Tables can also be self-joined. Imagine you have a table of employees and one of the fields is direct_reports which contains employee_ids of employees that report the original employee. You could do a SELF JOIN to get the information for the reports.</p>\n<p>Honestly 95% of what I do is covered by INNER and LEFT joins.</p>\n<p>One neat trick we could do here is a NATURAL JOIN.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span>\n  comment_id, comments.user_id, users.username, <span class=\"hljs-type\">time</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">LEFT</span>(comment, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> preview\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span>\n  comments\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">NATURAL</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INNER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">JOIN</span>\n  users\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span>\n  board_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">39</span>;\n</code></pre><p>This will work like it did above. NATURAL JOIN tells PostgreSQL &quot;I named things the same in both tables, go ahead and match it together yourself. This is fun when it lines up but I don&#39;t often end up using it myself. And in the end it&#39;s often better to be explicit what about your intent is for joins. So use cautiously and/or for neat party tricks.</p>\n<h2>Subqueries</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you need to find all the comments made by Maynord Simonich. You could make two queries: query for Kate&#39;s user_id from users, and then use that user_id to query comments. Or we could do it all at once with a subquery!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> comment_id, user_id, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">LEFT</span>(comment, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> comments <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span> user_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span> user_id <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span> users <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">WHERE</span> full_name <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;Maynord Simonich&#x27;</span>);\n</code></pre><p>This will query for Maynord&#39;s ID and immediately use that in the other query. Make sure this returns exactly one row or this will fail. You can use subqueries in a variety of ways but it generally looks like this with <code>()</code> surrounding the subqueries. You can even have subqueries in your subqueries!</p>\n<h2>GROUP BY</h2>\n<p>What if you were making a report and you wanted to show the top ten most posted-to message boards? You could run something like this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span>\n  boards.board_name, <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">COUNT</span>(<span class=\"hljs-operator\">*</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> comment_count\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span>\n  comments\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INNER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">JOIN</span>\n  boards\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span>\n  boards.board_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> comments.board_id\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">GROUP</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BY</span>\n  boards.board_name\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ORDER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BY</span>\n  comment_count <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">DESC</span>\nLIMIT <span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span>;\n</code></pre><p><code>GROUP BY</code> is going to collapse all the same board_names (guaranteed unique due to our UNIQUE constraint on the board) and then we use the <code>COUNT(*)</code> to count how many boards have that same <code>board_name</code>.

So what do we need? Well, the &quot;LEFT&quot; board here is the comments (the one that&#39;s in the FROM will be LEFT) and we don&#39;t need anything more from the comments board since all of them will show up in the query thanks to the foreign key constraints. So then we need a RIGHT JOIN! We need to include boards that don&#39;t have any comments. We also need to change <code>COUNT(*)</code> because any row counts for a <code>*</code> and that would make it look like there was one comment on our empty boards when in reality there was zero. We need therefore it to be <code>COUNT(comment_id)</code> because that will actually count how many comments exist.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">SELECT</span>\n  boards.board_name, <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">COUNT</span>(comment_id) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">AS</span> comment_count\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">FROM</span>\n  comments\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">RIGHT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">JOIN</span>\n  boards\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ON</span>\n  boards.board_id <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> comments.board_id\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">GROUP</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BY</span>\n  boards.board_name\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">ORDER</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">BY</span>\n  comment_count;\n</code></pre><p>Tricky!
