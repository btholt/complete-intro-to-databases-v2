Another way to think about this is that it is a place to save your application&#39;s state so that it can be retrieved later. This allows you to make your servers stateless since your database will be storing all the information. A lot of things can be thought of as a type of database, like an Excel spreadsheet or even just a text file with data in it.</p>\n<p>A query is a command you send to a database to get it to do something, whether that&#39;s to get information out of the database or to add/update/delete something in the database. It can also aggregate information from a database into some sort of overview.</p>\n<h2>Schema</h2>\n<p>If a database is a table in Microsoft Excel, then a schema is the columns.

It&#39;s the shape of the data. Some databases like PostgreSQL have strict schemas where you have to know the shape of your data upfront. Others like MongoDB let you invent it on the fly.</p>\n<h2>What are the types of databases</h2>\n<p>There are many types of database available today. We&#39;re only going to cover four types but it&#39;s good to know what else is other there.
